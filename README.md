# Introduction
Secure Reliable Transport (SRT) is an open source transport technology that optimizes streaming performance over the public Internet. 

* Secure - Encrypts Video Streams   
* Reliable - Recovers from Packet Loss
* Transport - Dynamically Adapts to Changing Network Conditions

As audio/video packets are streamed from a source to a destination device, SRT detects and adapts to the real-time network conditions between the two endpoints. SRT helps compensate for jitter and bandwidth fluctuations due to congestion over noisy networks, such as the Internet. Its error recovery mechanism minimizes the packet loss typical of Internet connections. And SRT supports AES encryption for end-to-end security, keeping your streams safe from prying eyes.

### TODO: Fix this section

The SRT protocol also allows you to save the log files from both the transmitter and receiver in different formats, one of which is CSV (comma separated values). The current project is using those CSV log files to analyze the SRT link and to provide quick overview of the network impairments as well as their relative timestamps. 

More information how you can install the SRT protocol could be found in the original [SRT Github repository](https://github.com/Haivision/srt)
